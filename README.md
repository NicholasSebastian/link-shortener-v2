# Link Shortener

To Do List

- Frontend UI in React: Login Page and Admin Page.
- Username and Password based Authentication with JWT.
- Basic CRUD app for links with SQLite integration.
- The actual 301 redirection routing service; no external libraries, just the std::net/http.
- Simple click count/stats and basic analytics.
- Tests.
- Build scripts and deployment.

Notes

- A single path can have multiple links, in which the target will be randomly chosen for each redirect.
